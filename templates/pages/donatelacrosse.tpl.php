While the growth of lacrosse is exploding in Indiana there are stills kids we are not able to reach because of the lack of funding. In an effort to help grow the sport at the high school level the IHSLA has helped teams with start up costs 
such as goals, balls, goalie equipment. The IHSLA also waves dues for first year teams. While this does help some teams need more. The IHSLA would like to partner with a group or individual 
that would like help cover the finical costs of starting a new team.  </p>
