<h3>About</h3>
<p> The Indiana High School Lacrosse Association is a non-profit organization run by volunteers devoted to the support of boys high school lacrosse.  
    The IHSLA is directed by a code of by-laws, voted on by its membership, which gives it the power to govern high school lacrosse in the state of 
    Indiana by providing common policies and rules for each season. These policies and rules consist of: </p>
<ul>
   <li>Establishing standards for eligibility consistent with the IHSAA.</li>
   <li>Establishing standards for coaches.</li>
   <li>Establishing standards for sportsmanship.</li>
   <li>Establishing state tournaments.</li>
   <li>Establishing state awards such as all state and all state academic.</li>
</ul>
<p>New members are voted in by current IHSLA members and are required to designate a high school as their home school.  Most members have no official affiliation with their home school and are run by volunteer parent boards.  Some members have club status with their home school and few have full varsity status with their home school.  The IHSLA encourages all members to continually seek full varsity status with their home school.  <p>

<p>The IHSLA has a 2 class system, Varsity and Club.  A new IHSLA member can choose which class they wish to participate in however once they reach 20 players form their home school they must participate in the varsity class the following season. Members participating in the varsity class are eligible for post season play and awards.  Varsity members must only draw players from their home school while club members may draw from multiple schools. </p>

<p>The IHSLA is governed by its legislative body, the Board of Directors. Composed of 7 members who are elected by member programs from 4 IHSLA legislative districts, North, Central, South, and at Large.  The directors serve staggered 2-year terms. The Board of Directors meets annually with the responsibility of establishing the Association’s policies and rules for that season. The Board is also responsible for organizing and directing state tournaments, contracting with an official organization, interpreting the Association's By-Laws, determining penalties for rules violations, establishing the Association's executive committee to administer the daily functions of the Association.</p>

<h3>Mission:</h3>
<p>The mission of the IHSLA is to provide high school students an opportunity  to play high school lacrosse for their school similar to other high school sports so that
   lacrosse may someday be adopted by the IHSAA.</p>
