<h3>History:</h3>

<center><h2>Indiana High School Lacrosse Association</h2>
<h3>Est. August 1998</h3></center>
<p>The Indiana High School Lacrosse Association had its humble beginnings in the summer of 1997. Justin Shay, a former University of Notre Dame lacrosse player and post-collegiate player for the Indianapolis based lacrosse team “Aiko”, invited some of his teammates to his apartment. Justin suggested to those the players, Brandon Burke, Byron Stankus and Jim Quirke, “Let’s start lacrosse in Indianapolis.”  From that meeting a plan was hatched. Justin became the new US Lacrosse, Indiana chapter president. Brandon agreed to emphasis youth lacrosse while Jim Quirke and Byron Stankus focused on establishing high school programs. </p>

<p>The group began with a free introduction to lacrosse clinic. The clinic was held at Cool Creek Park in Carmel and it featured the Butler men’s lacrosse head coach Jon Hind. Four kids attended. Then there were call out meetings at Westfield and Park Tudor schools. Needing more players to field these new teams, the group reached out to North Central and Carmel. The first Indianapolis teams were then formed; they were combination teams of Park Tudor/North Central lead by Byron Stankus and Westfield/Carmel lead by Jim Quirke. Quickly following that, the group got a call from James Ewing, one of the players that had attended the free clinic. He had gathered 30 or so students who wanted to start a team at Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School and they needed a coach. “Aiko” teammate Paul Borchelt stepped up and became their coach. These three teams then went out and played their first season along with Indiana’s other three existing teams, Culver Military Academy, St. Joseph’s school in South Bend and a club team called the Ft. Wayne Falcons.</p>

<p>Seeing a need for structure and organization, the “Aiko” teammates entrusted Byron Stankus to create and write by-laws for a governing association. Over that summer, they were written. In August of 1998, Justin Shay then invited representative from all of the potential Indiana high school teams to his new house to review and enact the by-laws. At that meeting, the by-laws were voted in, an executive board was elected and founding members of the new association were declared. </p>

<p>Culver Military Academy, with Tom Herald; St. Joseph’s with Ben Ganey; Park Tudor School with Byron Stankus; Wesfield with Jim Quirke; Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School with Paul Borchelt; Carmel, with Brandon Burke and Dave Boljonis; Hamilton Southeastern, with Justin Shay and North Central with Jeff Poto became the original eight teams in the new association. Byron Stankus was named President and the Indiana High School Lacrosse Association was established.</p>

<p>In the years following high school boys’ lacrosse has enjoyed tremendous growth and has been one of the fastest growing sports in the state of Indiana. The IHSLA is now an official 501c3 sanctioned non-for-profit association. And its members have spawned not only varsity level lacrosse programs and collegiate lacrosse players but also Junior varsity teams, freshman teams, club programs, middle school teams, youth organizations and girls lacrosse teams with their own governing association.</p>

<p>The Indiana High School Lacrosse Association is proud of its history and will continue to support and grow the sport of lacrosse in the state of Indiana and beyond.</p>
